Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Are the products all original products?
Yes, we only buy from trusted retailers. The consoles (except Nintendo DS series), PCs, notebooks, graphics cards and cell phones are all in their original packaging.

How do we do this?
We launder money by purchasing a lot of credit/gift cards from reliable sellers on Tor. We use these cards to buy consoles from trusted sellers (Amazon/Mediamarkt/Saturn/etc.). We sell these parts for BTC and buy new credit/gift cards with these BTC.

How can you pay?
Payments can be made via Bitcoin, Monero, Ethereum or Litecoin.
